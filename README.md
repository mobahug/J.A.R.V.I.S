# J.A.R.V.I.S

As a side project and my interest in A.I., I started to create, my own A.I. assistent, which is work in progress currently.

I am using python to improve my skills in that language.

The assistent already capable to do certain things, like open and play your favourite music on youtube, anwser to questions,
search on google, wikipedia and read for you, do jokes etc..

After you cloned the repository still have to install via terminal few things
in order to make the assistant to work.

1. `pip install SpeechRecognition`
2. `pip install pyttsx3`
3. `pip install pywhatkit`
4. `pip install wikipedia`
5. `pip install pyjokes`
6. `pip install googlesearch.py`

After the installations, just run the program and speak with your new assistant!
